1. Project Structure Guidelines
Organize your code in a clear directory structure with dedicated folders for each type of content
Keep components in their own folders with related files (TypeScript, CSS) together
Separate global styles, utilities, services, and types into their own directories
Store all assets (images, icons) in a dedicated assets folder
Keep main plugin pages/views in a pages directory
This structure helps prevent code duplication and makes it easier to find and maintain files
