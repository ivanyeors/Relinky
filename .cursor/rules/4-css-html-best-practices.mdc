CSS Guidelines

Define global CSS variables (custom properties) for consistent values across your plugin
Store common values like colors, spacing, and typography in CSS variables
Create component-specific CSS files to maintain modularity
Use meaningful class names that describe the component's purpose
Avoid magic numbers - use CSS variables instead
Structure CSS with a clear hierarchy
Use BEM (Block Element Modifier) or similar naming convention for classes
Keep styles reusable and maintainable

HTML Guidelines

Keep HTML files clean and focused on structure
Never include inline styles in HTML
Never write JavaScript directly in HTML files
Link to external CSS files properly in the head section
Link to JavaScript files at the end of the body
Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate
Maintain proper document structure with DOCTYPE and meta tags
Keep the root element clean for React/UI framework mounting
