#Current Features
- Scan for missing or unlinked variable references across documents
- Detect and manage library variables (team, local, and missing libraries)
- Identify raw values that could be converted to variables
- Analyze specific design token types (typography, colors, corner radius, padding, etc.)
- Real-time document watching for continuous token monitoring
- Selection-based or entire page scanning options
- Detailed grouping and filtering of scan results by type and property
- Interactive node selection directly from scan results
- Toggle visibility of hidden layers during scans
- Bulk selection of related components through grouped results
- Variable unlinking capabilities with property preservation
- Scan performance optimization with progress tracking
- Support for different variable types (color, number, boolean, string)
- Library status detection (active, inactive, remote, local)
- Detailed typography analysis with font properties breakdown
- Color preview with hex value display
- Grouped value detection for identifying similar properties
- Customizable scan settings to target specific token types
- Support for corner radius variants (individual and uniform)
- Padding analysis (horizontal and vertical)
- Gap detection in auto-layout frames

#Performance Optimizations
  - Implement progressive scanning with canceled promise handling to prevent UI freezing during large document scans
  - Add caching for variable and library lookups to reduce redundant API calls
  - Optimize node traversal with depth-limiting options for extremely large files
  - Add batch processing for variable operations to reduce Figma API overhead

#User Experience Enhancements
  - Create a "Quick Actions" panel for frequently used operations
  - Implement saved scan configurations to remember user preferences
  - Add visual diff comparison between current and proposed changes
  - Create a dashboard view showing document health metrics and token usage statistics

#Technical Improvements
  Refactor the scanning architecture to use a plugin/middleware pattern for better extensibility
  Implement a proper state management solution to replace the current data approach
  Break down large functions in scanners into smaller, testable units
  Add comprehensive error recovery with auto-rollback for failed operations

#New Features
  Token migration assistant to help transition between design systems
  Bulk variable operations with preview and selective application
  Integration with version control to track token changes over time
  Export/import functionality to share token configurations between files
